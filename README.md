## 🧮 **Component Breakdown**

### 🧠 `index.html` → Admin Dashboard

Designed for administrative oversight of user requests and platform metrics.

```
🎨 Theme: Light-bluish background (bg-blue-50) + dark navbar (bg-gray-800)
📊 E-Book Table: Blue headers (bg-blue-200), hover-enabled rows
🟩 Action Buttons: Rounded “Grant” buttons with green emphasis
📈 Summary Cards: Users | Requested | Granted | Available
🧭 Navigation: Smooth scroll from navbar → #summary-section
```

Each summary card adopts its own color identity:
`Indigo`, `Cyan`, `Green`, `Yellow` 🌈 — making the UI visually intuitive.

### 🔐 `login.html` & `register.html` → Authentication Pages

```
💧 Style: Liquid Glass / Glassmorphism with blur (backdrop-filter)
🌌 Background: Deep blue-purple gradient
🖋️ Typography: Light, readable text over transparent forms
🎨 Buttons: Cyan (Register) | Indigo/Cyan (Login)
```

A visually appealing and readable experience, blending **functionality** and **modern design**.
